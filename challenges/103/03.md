## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- Have a look the [GitHub marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

- [ ] create a new file `.github/workflows/linter.yml`

```yml
name: Linter

# Run this workflow every time a new commit pushed to your repository
on: push

jobs:
  # Set the job key. The key is displayed as the job name
  # when a job name is not provided
  super-lint:
    # Name the Job
    name: Lint code base
    # Set the type of machine to run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Checks out a copy of your repository on the ubuntu-latest machine
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Runs the Super-Linter action
      - name: Run Super-Linter
        uses: github/super-linter@v3
        env:
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

- [ ] Commit to a new branch
- [ ] Open up a pull request and observe the action working

There is a lot you can automate with GitHub actions.

As a react native devloper I use `actions/setup-node`, `expo/expo-github-action`, `mshick/add-pr-comment` to write a comment on each pull-request with a QR code to download the new version of my `iOS` and `Android` app on my phone for testing purposes.
